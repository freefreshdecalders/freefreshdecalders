A live check is actually an unsolicited loan offer. It is usually sent in the mail, and if you cash or deposit the check you are bound by its loan terms, which may include high interest rates for multiple years. Before cashing or depositing a live check, you should make sure you understand the terms, and shop around for other loan options to see if you can find a better rate.

Have you ever opened your mail and found an unexpected check? Some checks are refunds and payments due to you, others are sample advertisements, some are fake check scams
, and some checks are preapproved loans, or live check loan offers.
