If you endorse the check by signing the back of the check and cash or deposit the funds into your bank account, you have accepted the live check loan. It is a loan that you must repay on the due dates described in the loan agreement. If you pay late or do not pay, you may be charged fees along with interest, and the lender may report your debt to a credit reporting agency which could affect your credit score. To reject the loan offer, you should securely destroy—by shredding and throwing away—the live check to avoid potential fraudulent use by others.
